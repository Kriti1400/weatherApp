# weatherApp
An API-driven, fully functional weather app created using Vanilla Javascript, HTML, and CSS:
- includes a search form where user's can search for the weather data for particular cities
- lists the weather data for each city the user searches for, while prevening duplicates, using the OpenWeatherMap API
- uses geolocation to grab the user's location and get data for their local city from the OpenWeatherMap API

To run:
1. download the HTML, CSS, and Javascript files
2. replace the API key in scripts.js with your free, personal API key from OpenWeather
3. open the index.html in your browser and enjoy!

Created with reference to George Martsoukos's Web Design weather API tutorial (search, list for weather, CSS design) and J Simpson's Nordic API tutorial on building an API-driven weather app (geolocation)
